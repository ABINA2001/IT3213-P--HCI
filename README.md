We created a basic calculator that supports the following operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
It works just like a regular calculator with buttons and a display.

Tools and Features We Used
Dynamic panels to manage the calculator screen
Global variables to hold the values
OnClick events for each button
Conditions and cases to apply the calculation logic

This session helped us understand:
How to use Axureâ€™s interaction features
Creating logic-based interactions visually
Designing user interfaces that simulate real functionality
How to plan and build a working app step by step
